Cheap to host, easy to implement online system used in SMM:WE 3.4.0
## Features
- Works with Node.js (before it worked with PHP, but because of security issues, is now **deprecated**. If you take the risk you can find it in the PHP folder.)
- Progress and lives storage with MySQL
- Player leaderboards (highest records on each difficulty)
- Independent from the main online system developed by DangerousZone

## Setup
### First, create a MySQL db with this command. Replace "dsm" with the DB name you desire and "user_info" with the name of the table you desire.
```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dsm;

USE dsm;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_info (
    username VARCHAR(255),
    lives INT(11),
    difficulty INT(11),
    level_group INT(11),
    dsm_2 INT(11),
    easy_record INT(11),
    normal_record INT(11),
    hard_record INT(11),
    expert_record INT(11)
);
```
### Then, clone the repository and edit the configuration settings with your DB credentials and the port you desire the server to run on.
```
<?php
$servername = "127.0.0.1";
$username_db = "hexp";
$password_db = "hexpdelpino";
$dbname = "dsm2";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username_db, $password_db, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("db connection error: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$mangoToVerify = "9752752362299246";
```
## Starting the server

Run the batch file called "run.bat" or:
```
node index.mjs
```
Give me an ‚≠ê if you liked my work!

## How this works?
I didn't write this part of the guide yet since the code isn't out. Probably tomorrow?
